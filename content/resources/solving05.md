description: This resource tells  about using Ampere?s Law for calculating magnetic
  fields from symmetric current distributions, to find an expression for the magnetic
  field of a cylindrical current-carrying shell of inner radius a and outer radius
  b using Ampere?s Law and to find an expression for the magnetic field of a slab
  of current using Ampere?s Law.
